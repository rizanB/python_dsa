### Contributing


Contributions are welcome If you have any suggestions or ideas for new topics, please open an issue or submit a pull request.


### Acknowledgments

Many of the ideas in this playlist were inspired by the concepts and principles outlined in Data Structures: From Arrays to Priority Queues. I also love the neat aesthetics and it has helped me understand data structures way better than I used to. These are the resources that I've used for creating this playlist:

- Data Structures: From Arrays to Priority Queues, by Wayne Amsbury
- Artificial Intelligence, 3rd ed. by Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig (for search algorithms)
